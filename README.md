# CSUF Parking Chatbot

This chatbot will answer your questions regarding parking at CSUF and will assist you in finding the best place to park.

I've never made a chatbot before, so this is more of a test run. Since this is my first time making one, I went ahead and tried to comment everything that needs some background information.

I decided to go with AWS's Lex to make the chatbot. I chose Lex because I have some experience making Alexa skills. There are a good amount of similarities between the two. I recommend giving Lex a shot, it's pretty fun. You can find the documentation [here](https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/lex/) (I recommend the PDF).

Enjoy!
